    "## Importance of Variables  \n",
    "- **Data Representation**: Variables store and manage data efficiently.  \n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex data handling by using meaningful names.  \n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Allows dynamic changes to values during program execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Concepts  \n",
    "- **Single Values**: A variable holds one value at a time but can store collections like lists.  \n",
    "- **Meaningful Naming**: Improves readability and understanding of the code.  \n",
    "- **Data Types**: Variables can store different types of data, including:  \n",
    "  - **Numbers** (integers, floating-point)  \n",
    "  - **Booleans** (true/false)  \n",
    "  - **Strings** (text)  \n",
    "  - **Lists** (multiple values in a collection)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignments and Value Updates  \n",
    "- **Assignment Operator (`=`)**: Stores a value in a variable.  \n",
    "- **Execution Order**: The most recent assignment determines the variable’s value.  \n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "  ```python\n",

    "  b = a  \n",
    "  a = 2  \n",
