    "# Working Process\n",
    "## Step 1: Configure AWS Route 53 and Create a Subdomain\n",
    "To establish our website under the Nighthawk Coding Society, we will create a subdomain using AWS Route 53. This allows us to set up a custom domain for our deployed application.\n",
    "- Access AWS Route 53: Log in to AWS and navigate to the Route 53 dashboard.\n",
    "- Create a Subdomain: Within the hosted zone for Nighthawk Coding Society, add a new A record (or CNAME if applicable) to point the subdomain to our EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP.\n",
    "## Step 2: Update Ports and Configure Application for Deployment \n",
    "To ensure our application runs on a unique port, we will change all instances of *port 8887* to *port 8402* across our project. \n",
    "- Update Python Backend Modify main.py to run on the new port: ```python if _name_ == \"_main_\": app.run(debug=True, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8402)\n",
    "## Step 3: AWS EC2 Setup\n",
    "To host our application, we need to set up an EC2 instance on AWS. \n",
    "- First, we log in to the AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard. \n",
    "- We select the instance that will host our application, ensuring it is properly configured to allow incoming traffic on port 8402. \n",
    "- Security groups should be updated to permit HTTP and HTTPS requests. We also verify that our instance has Docker and Docker Compose installed to run the application containers.\n",
    "## Step 4: Application Deployment Through VSCode\n",
    "Before deploying to AWS, we test our application locally. \n",
    "- We check for an available port using docker ps and confirm that port 8402 is free.\n",
    "- In the backend terminal, we run make to start the server and replace any references to localhost:8887 with http://127.0.0.1:8402. This ensures the frontend can correctly communicate with the backend through the new port.\n",
    "## Step 5: Deployment in AWS EC2 Terminal\n",
    "Once the local test is successful, we move to deployment on AWS. \n",
    "- We SSH into our EC2 instance and clone the project repository. \n",
    "- Inside the project directory, we run `docker-compose up -d --build` to build and start the application in the background. To test the deployment, we replace localhost with our EC2 public IP and verify that the site is accessible on port 8402.\n",
    "## Step 6: Route 53 and Nginx Setup\n",
    "To map our domain to the EC2 instance\n",
    "- We create a new DNS record in AWS Route 53, pointing the subdomain to the public IP of our EC2 instance. \n",
    "- Then, we configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to our application. We write a custom Nginx configuration file, update the `proxy_pass` to http://localhost:8402, and restart Nginx to apply the changes.\n",
    "## Step 7: Certbot Certificate Setup\n",
    "To enable HTTPS, we use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate for our domain.\n",
    "- Running `sudo certbot --nginx`, we automatically configure Nginx to serve the website over HTTPS. \n",
    "- We also update the Nginx configuration to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS for security. After confirming the certificate installation, we restart Nginx to apply the changes.\n",
    "## Step 8: Code Updates and Version Control\n",
    "Once deployment is complete, any necessary code changes must be carefully managed.\n",
    "- We first run git pull to ensure we have the latest version of the code. \n",
    "- Any changes are committed with meaningful messages, but commits should not be made directly from the AWS terminal. \n",
    "- Locally, we test modifications by running docker-compose up and accessing http://127.0.0.1:8402 in a browser.\n",
    "## Step 9: Synchronizing AWS with Latest Changes\n",
    "To apply new updates in AWS, we SSH into the EC2 instance and navigate to the project directory. \n",
    "- We first stop the running containers using docker-compose down, then pull the latest changes using git pull. \n",
    "- After ensuring everything is up to date, we rebuild and restart the containers using `docker-compose up -d --build`.\n",
    "## Step 10: Final Testing and Debugging\n",
    "After deployment, we thoroughly test the website by checking different features and ensuring all API requests are functioning correctly. \n",
    "- If any errors are found, we debug by inspecting logs with docker logs <container_id>. \n",
    "- We also confirm that the HTTPS certificate is working, and the subdomain correctly routes to the EC2 instance. \n",
    "- If needed, we update security group settings to allow incoming traffic. Once everything is verified, the deployment process is complete, and the site is live for users."
