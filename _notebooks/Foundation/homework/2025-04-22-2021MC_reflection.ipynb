    "  - 15/26 topics at 100% mastery (e.g., Lists, Internet, Simulations)\n",
    "  - Strong in Data units (2.2-2.4) and Programming fundamentals (3.1, 3.4, 3.7-3.12)\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**:\n",
    "  - Critical gaps in \"Program Function and Purpose\" (0%) and \"Developing Procedures\" (0%)\n",
    "  - Lower scores in Boolean Expressions (75%), Conditionals (67%), and Mathematical Expressions (67%)\n",

    "### **Q58: (1.2)**  \n",
    "Which of the following data must be collected from a user’s smartphone in order for RunRoutr to suggest a running route?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses:**  \n",
    "A. Available running routes near the user’s home  \n",
    "B. The current time  \n",
    "C. The starting location of the user’s previous run  \n",
    "D. The user’s geographic position  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D (User's geographic position)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake:** Chose C (Previous run's start location)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Wrong:**  \n",
    "- Routes are based on **current** location, not past runs  \n",
    "- GPS is mandatory; historical data is optional  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:**  \n",
    "Real-time GPS is essential for location-based apps. Past data can improve suggestions but isn't required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Improve:**  \n",
    "1. Identify absolute requirements vs nice-to-have data  \n",
    "2. Focus on words like \"must\" in questions  \n",
    "3. Remember: live location powers most map/fitness apps\n",

    "### **Q59: (1.2)**  \n",
    "**Question:**  \n",
    "Adrianna uses RunRoutr to suggest a running route. All compatible users near Adrianna receive a notification that shows her running route. Which of the following data is not obtained using data collected from Adrianna’s smartphone but necessary for RunRoutr to share Adrianna’s running route?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses:**  \n",
    "A. Adrianna’s average running speed  \n",
    "B. Adrianna’s preferred running distance  \n",
    "C. The current locations of other RunRoutr users  \n",
    "D. The usernames on Adrianna’s contact list  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C (The current locations of other RunRoutr users)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake:** If chose A, B, or D  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Wrong:**  \n",
    "- **A (Running speed):** Collected from Adrianna's smartphone via GPS tracking  \n",
    "- **B (Preferred distance):** Input by Adrianna when requesting the route  \n",
    "- **D (Contact list):** Stored in Adrianna's profile (on her device/account)  \n",
    "- **C (Others' locations):** Must come from other users' devices, not Adrianna's  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:**  \n",
    "- **Data sourcing:** Distinguish between data collected from *one user's device* vs *external sources*  \n",
    "- **System design:** Features relying on multiple users require server-side aggregation (other users' GPS data)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Improve:**  \n",
    "1. Ask: *\"Can this data come solely from the primary user's device?\"*  \n",
    "2. For multi-user apps, identify dependencies on *networked data*  \n",
    "3. Note that contact lists (D) are user-generated data, while real-time locations (C) are actively transmitted  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q70: (3.4)**\n",
    "**Question:**  \n",
    "Create a new string by removing the character at position `n` of `oldStr` (1 < n < len(oldStr)). Select two correct solutions.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A and C  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Others Are Wrong:**  \n",
    "- **B:** Incorrectly includes the character at position `n` in both `left` and `right`  \n",
    "- **D:** Reverses the order of the string segments (would produce \"tbe\" instead of \"bet\" for \"best\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:**  \n",
    "String manipulation requires:  \n",
    "1. Correctly splitting around the target position (`n-1` and `n+1`)  \n",
    "2. Preserving original order when concatenating  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Case Proof:**  \n",
    "For `oldStr = \"best\"`, `n = 3`:  \n",
    "- A/C produce: `\"be\" + \"t\" = \"bet\"`  \n",
    "- B would produce: `\"bes\" + \"est\" = \"besest\"`  \n",
    "- D would produce: `\"t\" + \"be\" = \"tbe\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Improve:**  \n",
    "1. Visualize string positions with index numbers  \n",
    "2. Verify edge cases (n at start/end of string, though excluded here)  \n",
    "3. Check concatenation order matches original sequence\n",
