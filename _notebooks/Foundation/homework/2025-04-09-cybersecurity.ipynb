    "## Landscape - Real-World Track\n",
    "- Cybersecurity is deeply connected to real-world scenarios and threats.\n",
    "- **Ransomware**: Attackers encrypt data and demand ransom; it’s highly satisfying for professionals to track down and stop these cybercriminals.\n",
    "- Focus on **data security**: Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information is a top priority.\n",
    "- Agreements and reports are crucial when it comes to data theft—responsible disclosure matters.\n",
    "- Major threats include:\n",
    "  - Companies being shut down by attacks.\n",
    "  - Intellectual property (IP) being stolen.\n",
    "- **Phishing attacks**: Users are tricked into clicking malicious links, making systems vulnerable.\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is now used both by attackers and defenders in the cybersecurity field.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Concerns in Society\n",
    "- Ethical issues arise when using the same technologies as hackers to protect systems.\n",
    "- Stay alert to **backdoors** and be familiar with different security **frameworks**.\n",
