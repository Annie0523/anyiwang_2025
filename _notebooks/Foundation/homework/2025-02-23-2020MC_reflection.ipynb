    "### Q14: Display Digits in Reverse Order  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement  \n",
    "The following algorithm is intended to take a positive integer as input and display its individual digits in order from right to left. For example, if the input is **512**, the algorithm should produce the output:  2 1 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 of the algorithm is missing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Given Algorithm  \n",
    "1. **Step 1:** Input a positive integer from the user and store it in the variable `number`.  \n",
    "2. **Step 2:** Divide `number` by 10 and record:  \n",
    "   - The **integer quotient** (quotient with the decimal part dropped).  \n",
    "   - The **remainder** (last digit of `number`).  \n",
    "3. **Step 3:** (Missing Step)  \n",
    "4. **Step 4:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `number` becomes 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choices  \n",
    "Which of the following can be used as **Step 3** so that the algorithm works as intended?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Display the remainder of `number` divided by 10 and store the remainder in `number`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** Display the remainder of `number` divided by 10 and store the integer quotient in `number`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** Display the integer quotient of `number` divided by 10 and store the remainder in `number`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**D.** Display the integer quotient of `number` divided by 10 and store the integer quotient in `number`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correct Answer: **B**  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- **Step 2** gives the remainder (last digit) and the integer quotient.  \n",
    "- **Step 3** should display the remainder (the last digit).  \n",
    "- **Step 3** should also store the integer quotient back into `number` so that in the next iteration, the process continues with the remaining digits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the correct step is:  \n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Step 3: Display the remainder of number divided by 10 and store the integer quotient in number.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why **A** is Incorrect:  \n",
    "- **A stores the remainder in `number`**, which leads to an **infinite loop** unless `number` is a multiple of 10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:  \n",
    "- **Input:** `512`  \n",
    "  1. Step 1: `512 % 10 = 2`, store `number = 2`  \n",
    "  2. Step 2: `2 % 10 = 2`, store `number = 2` (loop continues forever)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop because `number` never reduces to `0`.  \n",

    "A file storage application allows users to save their files on cloud servers. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first eight years of the application’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the following graphs. The line graph on the left shows the number of registered users each year.

    "Which of the following best describes the average amount of data stored per user for the first eight years of the application’s existence?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Across all eight years, the average amount of data stored per user was about 10 GB.\n",

    "**B.** Across all eight years, the average amount of data stored per user was about 100 GB.\n",

    "\n",
    "**D.** The average amount of data stored per user appears to increase by about 100 GB each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correct Answer: **A**  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- To determine the average amount of data stored per user, we compare the **Total Amount of Data Stored** graph with the **Number of Registered Users** graph.  \n",
    "- From the graphs, each year’s total data storage (in million GB) is approximately **10 times** the number of users (in million users).  \n",
    "- This means the average storage per user is:  \n",
    "Average storage per user = Total Data Stored / Number of Users ≈ 10 GB per user\n",

    "#### Why **B** is Incorrect:  \n",
    "- Each value on the **Total Amount of Data Stored** graph is about **10 times** the corresponding value on the **Registered Users** graph.  \n",
    "- This suggests that the **average amount of data stored per user** is approximately **10 GB**, not **100 GB**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Statements:**  \n",
    "1. A central monitoring computer is used to track and maintain the connections of the Internet.  \n",
    "2. Data is routed between points in multiple ways so that if a connection fails, the data can be rerouted around the inoperative connections.  \n",

    "**C.** II and III only  \n",
    "**D.** I, II, and III  \n",

    "#### **Correct Answer: C (II and III only)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ **Statement II (Correct)**:  \n",
    "- The Internet is designed with **redundant routing paths** to ensure reliable communication.  \n",
    "- If a network connection fails, **packet-switching technology** allows data to be **rerouted dynamically** through alternative paths.  \n",
    "- This ensures **fault tolerance**, meaning the Internet remains operational even when some connections go down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ **Statement III (Correct)**:  \n",
    "- The Internet relies on **standardized protocols**, such as **TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS**, to allow communication between devices from different manufacturers.  \n",
    "- These protocols define **how data is formatted, transmitted, and received**, ensuring that all devices can work together seamlessly.  \n",

    "| **A (`Lines 1 and 2 should be interchanged`)** | No need to interchange the initialization of `i` and `sum`. Starting `i = 1` and `sum = 0` is logical for summing the first 10 elements, as long as the increment happens correctly. |\n",
    "| **B (`Line 3 should be changed to REPEAT UNTIL (i ≥ 10)`)** | `REPEAT UNTIL (i > 10)` is correct because `i` starts at 1. The loop should stop when `i` exceeds 10, ensuring that 10 elements are summed. Changing the condition to `i ≥ 10` would cause the loop to stop too early. |\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is intended to count the number of perfect numbers between `start` and `end`. However, there are issues with how the `count` and `currentNum` are being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Line 5** increments `count` for each iteration of the loop, even when the number is not perfect. This is unnecessary because we only want to count perfect numbers.\n",
    "- **Line 8** increments `count` again inside the `IF` block when `IsPerfect(currentNum)` returns true. This causes an incorrect double increment when a perfect number is found.\n",
    "- **Line 9** increments `currentNum` inside the `IF` block, which is not needed because `currentNum` should only be incremented once per loop iteration.\n",
    "- **Line 11** correctly increments `currentNum` during each iteration of the loop, but it is redundant because **Line 9** also increments `currentNum` when a perfect number is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix the program, we need to:\n",
    "- Remove **Line 5** to avoid incrementing `count` in each iteration regardless of whether the number is perfect.\n",
    "- Remove **Line 11** because the loop should increment `currentNum` only once per iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Other Answers Are Incorrect:\n",
    "- **B.** Removing **Line 8** would prevent the correct double increment of `count` when a perfect number is found, so it is not the correct choice.\n",
    "- **C.** Removing **Line 9** would not solve the issue because **Line 11** is also redundant.\n",
